# Credit Risk Classification ‚Äì Machine Learning Project

### Overview
End-to-end **machine learning pipeline** to classify credit card accounts as **‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad.‚Äù** Includes data prep, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and explainability.

### Tech Stack
**Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** ‚Ä¢ Jupyter Notebook ‚Ä¢ Git/GitHub

###  Workflow
1. Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling)
2. Feature engineering (utilization ratio, payment behavior)
3. Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
4. Evaluation (accuracy, precision/recall, ROC-AUC)
5. Explainability (feature importance, confusion matrix)
6. Model export (joblib pipeline)

### Results (placeholder)
- Best Model: TBD  
- ROC-AUC: TBD  
- Key drivers: utilization ratio, repayment history
